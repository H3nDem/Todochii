# Todochii

## Description
My first big project that i've done with 3 friends whithin an month and a half, an original concept that combine todolists and tamagotchi, the objective was to motivate the user to realize their intended tasks so they'll rewarded by points that can be spended for feeding their pets

The todolists part is simple but do the job, there aren't any advanced features that you may see in your usual todolist app, the tamagotchi part is simpler than the original concept in the way you only have to care about their hunger and there is not an evolve and death systems, however you can have several pets (only one at the time on the screen and choose which one to display), and also customizable background elements (such as the walls, the floor, a piece of furniture)

All the elements and pets can be bought in the shop for some points (the same used to feed your pet), which is also pretty simple, you have the name of the items and their prices
